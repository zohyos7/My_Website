# About me

I'm currently working as a Lab Manager in [CCS lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io). I received B.A. in Psychology and Education from [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr) with summa cum laude. 

I'm interested in the way people perceive and represent other people's minds, and how this changes by learning from others' reactions. Also, I am curious about varying degrees of consideration given to other people's minds, and how we reconcile the self and others' interests in making social decisions. Ultimately, I would like to identify the interplay of contexts and motives which give rise to the different modalities of human social minds, shifting from being caring and altruistic to being atrocious and selfish. By applying computational modeling model-based fMRI, I aim to advance the mechanicdal understanding of the neural mechanisms in the swinging pendulum of the human social mind-what goes on in each component of cognitive processing in interpersonal contexts.

It is my life-long goal that with my active research and publications, I will provide valuable opportunies for a broader audience, myself included, to contemplate our everyday social decisions in interpersonal contexts and how we could do better. Ultimately, I hope that my research will help to build a more caring society, where people successfully take into consideration and choose to respect each other's feelings and thoughts.
